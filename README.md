# Programmatic Navigation

Here we are using react-router and react-router-dom library for navigation.

We have two routes defined, one is index '/' which renders the <code>Counter</code> component
and other is '/five' which Renders the <code>Five</code> component.

Modify the code inside <code>Counter</code> component such that when counter value reaches five, it navigates to 
'/five' automatically.
